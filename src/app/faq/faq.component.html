      <h1 style="color: #3CB371;">How do I start using Jussimple?</h1>
      <br />
      <h3>
        It's simple. Once you register the Custom Systems, Charts, and Indicator
        tools will be sent to your email within 24 hours along with a video
        explaining how to install them. Once installed the setup is permanent
        and you own the Custom Systems & Tools for life.
      </h3>
      <br />
      <br />
      <h1 style="color: #3CB371;">Are there any fees?</h1>
      <br />
      <h3 >
        There are no fees. Once your trading account is setup we install the
        Custom Systems & Tools to your preferred laptop or computer so you own
        them for life. This includes any support and maintenance required long
        term. The Custom System and Tools have never been changed since their
        creation ten years ago but imagine, that one day computer screens don't
        exist anymore and we have to re-code the charting itself! You might need
        to contact us then.

      <br />
      <h1 style="color: #3CB371;">How does Jussimple make money?</h1>
      <br />
      <h3 >
        Jussimple makes all of it's money from private investments and from
        referral commissions and partners. You can learn more by emailing
        support@jussimple.com.

      <br />
      <br />
      <h1 style="color: #3CB371;">Do I need any experience to start?</h1>
      <br />
      <h3 >
        None at all. In fact the less experience you have the better. Experience
        and existing ideas can distract you from learning new things and
        paralyze your actions as your mind attempts to hang onto old habits.
        Anyone can begin to get rid of all the noise and get it right the first
        time. â€‹

        Does Jussimple open my trading account for me?

      <br />
      <h3 >
        No. Jussimple does not accept and does not allow the sending of trading
        funds to Jussimple. Instead we guide you with the correct knowledge to
        know exactly how to trade on your own and keep your money safe in your

      <h3>
        No. The Systems and Tools provided to traders here are proprietary
        algorithms, sequences, and pattern recognition tools built for traders,
        by traders. You cannot find this system or any of its components
        anywhere else as they are a result of 15+ years of live testing in the
        markets after trying thousands of different indicators and strategies
        one by one. These systems and custom tools are the result of thousands
        of failures after analyzing and testing all market conditions. After
        discovering the few things that do work and automating them into a set
        of rules we've simplified the process to deliver it to you for your long

        With so many myths and misinformation online related to trading we aim
        to demystify this industry and equip traders with the correct knowledge

        been trading live for over 15+years. Having tested and built thousands

        know exactly what NOT to do in the trading industry to teach you the few
        things that work consistently in all markets and time frames. What we
        deliver to you is the result of constant demand from friends and family
        who have requested our assistance in learning how to trade and wanting
        to run a trading business long term. Once you do the math, nobody is
        creating wealth from this industry without hard work and understanding
        how to run a trading business long term. We developed this all in one
        Custom System of rules to give you the correct knowledge and
        understanding required to trade consistently and truly grow in this
        industry as legitimate professionals. We can spend years telling you the
        same thing over and over again and you may still never put it into
        practice. Meanwhile someone else may have listened on day one and
        transformed their life the same year. Knowledge and tools are
        meaningless unless you apply them and take action. For this reason we

        entirely grasp and understand. Once you connect the pieces it will
        become about staying disciplined and consistent as you follow this

        How much technical analysis or news based trading is used?

      <h3>
        Every market variable has been accounted for including all indicators,
        technical analysis, fundamental analysis, news, and human bias
        variables. With every aspect of the market isolated and converted into a
        quantified system we provide you the exact strategy necessary to execute
        trades safely and long term on a consistent basis. Once you use the
        system you will understand and radically transform your ideas about the

        What size should my trading account be?
      </h1>
      <br />
      <h3>
        There are no minimums in sizes. Everything is matched to exact
        percentage based ratios. This means there is no difference between an
        account that is $5,000 or $500,000. All trades match the ratio of the
        balance. We teach you how to trade with small incremental trade sizes to
        stay safe and conservative while trading. Remember, 1% is 1% in both
        accounts of $5,000 and $50,000 balance. The difference is that 1% on
        $5,000 is $50 and 1% on $50,000 is $500. Everything is a matter of
        perception and scale. There is no limit to trading size.

        Will this work in any market and any time frame?
      </h1>
      <br />
      <h3>
        Yes. All markets are inherently lines moving up and down on a screen
        once you get rid of the market name and human bias variables. Once you
        understand the markets in their simplest form you will understand that
        they can be organized into exact range based patterns to determine up
        and down moving trends. This systematic approach allows you to customize
        your charts to any size to trade based on your schedule whenever you
        want, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. All markets are the same and the
        only reason people don't know this is because they have not tested and
        analyzed over 50+ years of market data down to the millisecond. We did
        this work for you and will teach you how to use it in your daily trading
        cycle.

        How many trades per day?
      </h1>
      <br />
      <h3>
        With the standard setup of 6-8 markets saved on the platform there will
        be approximately 7-10 trades per hour. These cycles can be executed once
        or twice a day to build a consistent habit of systematic trading
        expertise.

        The important thing is to see what they offer. We use our systems every
        day and this is the only way that we make full time income. It's
        important to understand the difference between training that is just
        made to take your money, and systems that are designed to be lifelong
        tools that you can execute whenever you want, as much as you want, and
        that continue producing results no matter what market conditions exist.
        We have tested thousands of indicators, systems, mechanisms, money
        making schemes, and infrastructures to understand what NOT to do. By
        dissecting each aspect into individual steps and complicating the
        trading industry to the extreme, we were able to quantify it into a few
        simple steps that need to be executed daily in order to run a successful
        trading business. Our systems will work forever and we will continue
        using them no matter what. It's up to you if you wish to do the same.

        I don't want to trade right now, should I still own this?

      <h3>
        Yes. Our system and tools allow individuals who do not want to invest to
        make money long term. Learn how trading referrals work and grow your
        residual income base by collecting profits from trading transactions.
        This is a great way for you to rapidly grow your income base without
        having any investments. Then, one day if you feel like it maybe you can
        start trading yourself.

        Can I trade longer than 20-60 minutes per day?
      </h1>
      <br />
      <h3>
        Yes. There is no limit to the amount of time you spend using our Custom
        Systems and Charting Tools. You can change your schedule to trade
        whenever you want. There is no difference when it comes to our
        simplified approach. All markets and all time frames are the exact same.

      <h1 style="color: #3CB371;">
        What about losses?
      </h1>
      <br />
      <h3>
        Trading strategies cannot exist without losing trades. It is inevitable
        and you cannot be making 100% profitable trades all the time as the
        market swings both up and down. You can take trades on both rising and
        falling markets and profit or lose on both sides of the trade. If 100%
        of your trades were profitable you would be a billionaire in a few
        years. This makes no sense because that means a billionaire would be a
        trillionaire and that just isn't logical. By following systematic and
        exact rules our Custom Systems and Charting Tools are able to identify
        key turning points in market movement to identify exact entries and
        exits on every trade one by one. Once you understand this process you
        will be able to trade without stress, worry, or confusion about where
        the markets going. Everything is exactly defined to give you confidence
        and peace of mind while trading.
